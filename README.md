## API request list

all commands below based on the 'host/port/' url.

Example: GET('/') => Get request with "localhost/3000/test" url.

You might need to adjust your host and port accordingly.

To set the bearer key, set 'Authorization' header to format 'bearer {YOUR KEY}'

Every json data with curly bracket (ex. : "{username}") means the username data in strings. Data with square bracket (ex. : [user_id]) means the user_id is in integer or number. You should handle it as 1 instead of "1" in the body part of the request.
